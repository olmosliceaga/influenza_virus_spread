Codes for manuscript: Ex vivo experiments shed light on the innate immune response from influenza virus
Authors: Daniel Olmos Liceaga, Sandro Filipe Nunes and Roberto A. Saenz

The codes were written in MATLAB for MODELS I, II and III (See manuscript).
For each of the models, there are three codes.
a) A code to generate the simulated data (LHSdesign_MODEL_X.m)
b) A code to generate the trajectories of the virus and infected cells evolution (Simulations_ComputeErrorsandTrajectories_MODEL_III.m)
c) A code to plot the results (plotTrajectories_MODEL_I.m)
